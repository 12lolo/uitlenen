# Cleanup and Deployment Summary

## Completed Cleanup Tasks

1. Removed unnecessary testing and troubleshooting scripts from production:
   - test_*.sh
   - setup_*.sh (except setup_cron.sh)
   - fix_*.sh
   - final_*.sh
   - Other temporary files

2. Cleaned up development files from production:
   - phpunit.xml
   - vite.config.js
   - tests directory
   - Other development-only files

3. Optimized the production environment:
   - Set proper file permissions
   - Configured APP_DEBUG=false for security
   - Cleaned up unnecessary files to reduce disk usage

## New Files Created

1. `deploy_production.sh` - Streamlined deployment script for future use
2. `maintenance.sh` - Utility script for ongoing maintenance tasks
3. `check_production.sh` - Script to verify the production environment status
4. `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Documentation on deployment process
5. `scripts_to_remove.md` - List of scripts that can be safely removed

## Important Files to Keep

1. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `deploy_production.sh` - Main deployment script
   - `cleanup_production.sh` - Production cleanup script
   - `setup_cron.sh` - Cron job setup script
   - `check_production.sh` - Production environment check script
   - `maintenance.sh` - Maintenance utility script

2. **Documentation**:
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment instructions
   - `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
   - `documentation/` - Project documentation

3. **Environment Files**:
   - `.env` - Local environment configuration
   - `.env.example` - Example environment configuration
   - `.env.production` - Production environment configuration template

## Future Deployment Process

1. Make changes to your local development environment
2. Test thoroughly
3. Run `./deploy_production.sh` to deploy to production
4. Run `./cleanup_production.sh` if needed to clean up the production environment
5. Use `./maintenance.sh` for ongoing maintenance tasks

## Additional Notes

- The production environment is now properly configured and optimized
- Cron jobs have been set up for scheduled tasks
- The application is running at https://uitleensysteemfirda.nl
- Permissions are correctly set for storage and cache directories
- Debug mode is disabled in production for security
