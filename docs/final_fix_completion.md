## Deployment Instructions

1. Run the final deployment script:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Verify admin functionality on the production server:
   ```bash
   ssh -p 65002 u540587252@92.113.19.61
   cd /home/u540587252/domains/uitleensysteemfirda.nl/public_html
   ./verify_admin_functionality.sh
   ```

3. Run comprehensive verification:
   ```bash
   ./comprehensive_verification.sh
   ```

## Final Security Checks

1. **Password Exposure**: ✅ Removed from UserController responses
2. **Authorization**: ✅ Controller-level admin checks implemented
3. **File Cleanup**: ✅ Comprehensive cleanup script removes all test files
4. **File Permissions**: ✅ Proper permissions set on all files

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. Monitor the server logs for 24 hours after deployment:
   ```bash
   ssh -p 65002 u540587252@92.113.19.61
   cd /home/u540587252/domains/uitleensysteemfirda.nl/public_html
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

2. Perform regular health checks on the admin endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://uitleensysteemfirda.nl/api/admin-health-check"
   ```

3. Document any issues in the system records
   ssh -p 65002 u540587252@92.113.19.61
   cd /home/u540587252/domains/uitleensysteemfirda.nl/public_html/
   ./verify_admin_functionality.sh
   ```

3. Monitor the error logs for any remaining issues:
   ```bash
   tail -f /home/u540587252/domains/uitleensysteemfirda.nl/public_html/storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

The admin functionality should now be working correctly and securely.
