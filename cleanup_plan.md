# Project Cleanup and Organization Plan

This document outlines which files should be deleted, moved to tools/scripts, or moved to documentation.

```

create_item_test.html

t, fetch the remote repository
ter
test_admin.php

```

## Files to Keep in Root Directory

These are essential Laravel project files that should remain in the root directory:

```
.editorconfig
.env
.env.production
.gitattributes
.gitignore
README.md
artisan
composer.json
composer.lock
package.json
phpunit.xml
vite.config.js
```

## Executing the Cleanup

To execute this cleanup plan:

1. First, back up your entire project directory
2. Create any missing directories in tools/scripts (deployment, testing, maintenance, setup, admin-fix)
3. Move files to their new locations
4. Delete the temporary/testing files
5. Update any references or imports in your code that might be affected by the reorganization

This reorganization will significantly clean up your project structure and make it more maintainable.
